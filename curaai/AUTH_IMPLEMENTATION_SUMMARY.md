## Integration Details

### Supabase Integration
- All pages use your existing `useAuth` hook from `/contexts/AuthContext`
- Password reset uses `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()`
- Email verification uses `supabase.auth.verifyOtp()`
- User metadata is stored during signup with professional information

### Toast Notifications
- Uses existing Sonner library for user feedback
- Success, error, and info messages throughout the flow
- Portuguese language messages

### Routing
- All auth pages follow Next.js 13+ app directory structure
- Proper redirects between authentication states
- Protected main dashboard route

## How to Use

### For Development:
1. The system is ready to use with your existing Supabase configuration
2. All routes are accessible:
   - `/auth/login` - Login page
   - `/auth/signup` - Registration page
   - `/auth/forgot-password` - Password recovery
   - `/auth/reset-password` - Password reset (accessed via email link)
   - `/auth/verify` - Email verification
3. The main dashboard (`/`) is now protected and will redirect to login

### For Users:
1. **New Users**: Go to `/auth/signup` for two-step registration
2. **Existing Users**: Use `/auth/login` to access the dashboard
3. **Forgot Password**: Click "Esqueceu a senha?" on login page
4. **Email Verification**: Automatically redirected after signup if email confirmation is enabled

## Next Steps

### Optional Enhancements:
1. **Social Authentication**: Implement Google/Microsoft OAuth buttons
2. **Email Templates**: Customize Supabase email templates with CuraAI branding
3. **Role-based Access**: Add different user roles (doctor, admin, etc.)
4. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Add optional 2FA for enhanced security
5. **Professional Verification**: Implement CRM verification workflow

### Configuration:
- Ensure Supabase email confirmation is configured in your project settings
- Set up custom email templates if desired
- Configure redirect URLs in Supabase for password reset

The authentication system is now complete and ready for production use! ðŸš€
